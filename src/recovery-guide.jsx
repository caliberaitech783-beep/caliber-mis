    <p className="recovery-lede">To bring Caliber Pulse back after any disaster you need four things. Only the first changes every day, so that is what the scheduled backup protects.</p>

    <h2>Trial: set it up and prove it works</h2>
    <ol className="recovery-trail">
      <li><h3>Check the nightly server backup</h3><p>Open {open("Backup Schedule", "Backup Schedule")}. The switch should show <b>Active</b>, every weekday ticked, 2:00 AM and retention 30. Click <b>Save schedule</b> if you changed anything.</p></li>
      <li><h3>Make a backup now</h3><p>On the same page click <b>Run backup now</b>. Then open {open("Backup", "Backup")}: the newest row should say <b>Completed</b> with a size and a checksum.</p></li>
      <li><h3>Create a key for your PC</h3><p>On {open("Backup Schedule", "Backup Schedule")}, scroll to <b>Copy backups to a PC</b>. Type a name such as "Head office desktop", click <b>Create PC key</b>, then <b>Copy key</b>. The key is shown only once.</p></li>
      <li><h3>Download and run the setup script on that PC</h3><p>Click <b>Download PC setup script</b>. In Downloads, right-click <code>Caliber-Pulse-Backup-Setup.ps1</code> and choose <b>Run with PowerShell</b>. Answer four questions: the folder, the time (3:00 AM), how many copies to keep (30), and paste the key.</p></li>
      <li><h3>Watch the first copy</h3><p>The script runs the first copy straight away and prints a line such as <code>Copied Caliber Pulse-Backup-….ndjson.gz (12.4 MB, SHA-256 verified)</code>. The key's <b>Last copy</b> time updates and the {open("Audit Trail", "Audit Trail")} shows <b>Copy backup to PC</b>.</p></li>
      <li><h3>Confirm the daily schedule</h3><p>In Windows <b>Task Scheduler</b> find <b>Caliber Pulse backup copy</b>. A log of every copy is kept in <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\NerveCenterBackup\backup-copy.log</code>.</p></li>
      <li><h3>Practise a restore without changing anything</h3><p>Open {open("Import Backup", "Import Backup")} as a Super Admin and choose a file from your PC folder. The app reads the whole file, checks it is complete and shows the rows per table. <b>Stop there</b>: nothing has changed. Repeat this drill once a month.</p></li>
