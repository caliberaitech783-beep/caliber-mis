# Caliber Pulse project workflow

## Telegram BDMS chatbot

Result lists now provide request-selection buttons and guided follow-ups: maintenance work and daily remarks, recorded lifecycle timestamps, permitted linked requests, permitted vehicle history, and role-appropriate first-trip/MIS details. Back to results and Main menu support navigation. `telegram-bdms-conversation.mjs` stores only selected request/list-query identifiers in conversation context, alongside the language preference. Each detail turn reloads current authorization and scoped records; unknown, archived or newly inaccessible selections are denied. The same engine powers the fictional local trial and authenticated preview.

Menus and typed-query authorization now follow the current BDMS role: Production sees its own requests and first-trip work, Maintenance sees repairs and ageing, MIS sees verification work, managers/administrators see scoped summaries and queues, and permitted General Users get read-only reporting. Queries outside a role's menu are rejected server-side, not merely hidden. Current site assignments still apply to every query across all eight configured BDMS sites. The trial has explicit fictional role/site simulation controls; production users cannot select or impersonate these identities.

The pilot now asks for English or Hindi before accepting a query. Language preference is persisted in `app_settings` under the linked login's `telegram_bdms_chat_language:` key; `/start` and Change language return to the language chooser. The welcome MP3 says “Welcome to Caliber Pulse. Please select your language first, then choose your query” in English and Hindi. Telegram displays it as a tap-to-play audio message, not automatic playback. Expanded menus include site summary, closed requests, first-trip pending, MIS pending and oldest-first breakdown ageing. Record content stays as entered; interface labels use the chosen language.

The read-only private-chat pilot in `telegram-bdms-chatbot.mjs` supports Open breakdowns, Running BD, door/request lookup, pending first-trip/MIS entries and bilingual help. It does not support Accounts, IBOSS, unrestricted AI questions, approvals or write actions. `POST /api/telegram/bdms-chatbot/preview` requires a BDMS session and returns an answer without sending a Telegram message.

The approved release enables the chatbot for connected eligible BDMS users by default. `TELEGRAM_BDMS_CHATBOT_ENABLED=false` disables it. An optional comma-separated `TELEGRAM_BDMS_CHATBOT_PILOT_LOGINS` restricts rollout when set; an empty allowlist admits all eligible linked BDMS users. A private chat with several linked BDMS logins presents explicit /account login choices. The selection is saved per chat and rechecked against current links every turn. /account returns to the chooser; removed links cannot retain access. A single linked login is selected automatically. Notification connections are preserved. Current employee/privilege records are rechecked; Info Pulse site scope and request visibility rules apply, and Production users are further restricted to their own requests. Existing webhook secret checks, account linking, stop handling and group notifications are preserved. Open the existing CALIBER BDMS private Telegram chat and send /start, choose English or Hindi, then use the role-specific menu. Groups continue their existing notification behavior.

This is the maintainer guide for the Caliber Pulse breakdown and fleet-management application. It describes the current source in this repository, the production flow, and the rules that connect users, masters, requests, reports, and deployment.

## 1. What the application does

Vehicle transfers shows the standard **Sync Oracle** button without a date field and retains full-history sync behavior. The protected transfer-sync API still accepts an optional `fromDate` as `YYYY-MM-DD` for explicitly requested one-time syncs; it is inclusive and preserves earlier Oracle transfer records. Equipment Master sync remains unchanged.

Caliber Pulse is a mining-operations portal for:

- equipment and vehicle records;
- regions, sites, hierarchy, OEM, repair-type, privilege, and employee masters;
- production maintenance requests;
- maintenance editing, closing, and deletion;
- MIS verification and first-trip tracking;
- site-wise and OEM WhatsApp report preparation;
- dashboards, reports, and audit-oriented history.

The application has two interfaces:

1. **Super User workspace**: dashboard, masters, WhatsApp Integration, Reports, and Audit Trail.
2. **Mobile User workspace**: a role-specific request workspace for Production User, Maintenance User, or MIS User, plus the configurable menu workspace for General User.

## 3. Local development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer. The GitHub workflow currently builds with Node.js 22.
- PostgreSQL, normally Azure Database for PostgreSQL in production.
- A `DATABASE_URL` connection string for any database-backed run.

Install dependencies and run the checks:

~~~powershell
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
~~~

Run the Vite development UI:

~~~powershell
npm run dev
~~~

Run the Express server against the generated `dist` directory:

~~~powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DATABASE"
npm start
~~~

For an isolated loopback PostgreSQL fixture that does not enable TLS, also set
`DATABASE_SSL=false`. Leave it unset in Azure so production continues to use TLS.

`server.mjs` listens on `PORT` when set, otherwise port `3000`. The server serves `dist` when `dist/index.html` exists and otherwise serves the repository root.

## 4. Application startup and data loading

1. The browser loads `index.html`, then `src/main.jsx` mounts `<App />`.
2. The app restores `nerveCenterSession` from `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` if present.
3. The app checks `/api/app-version` every 10 seconds. A changed version clears browser sessions and reloads the login page. This is how a newly deployed UI logs out stale users.
4. The Express process starts listening immediately, then runs PostgreSQL migrations. If migration fails, the server retries every 30 seconds.
5. Successful migration seeds the six repair types once: Breakdown, Accidental, Preventive, Aggregate Repair, Super Structure, and WGM.
6. Each master page calls `GET /api/masters`. Master loaders remain visible until the request completes. The app displays a short data-load toast after a menu loads.

## 5. Authentication and role flow

The login form accepts the employee first name or configured login name, the password, and the selected Super User or Mobile User access type. The server does not trust the browser for the account data:

1. `/api/login` finds matching `Users & employees` records.
2. It filters candidates to the selected access type and verifies either the stored scrypt hash or the initial phone-number password.
3. It resolves the account type from the user record and the assigned mobile role from the matching Privilege record.
4. Mobile roles are limited to `Production User`, `Maintenance User`, and `MIS User`.
5. A PostgreSQL session is created in `auth_sessions`. The session contains the account type, login name, assigned role, and permission flags.
6. If `mustChangePassword` is true, the server creates a short-lived password-change session instead. The user must complete `/api/change-initial-password` before receiving a normal session.

New application users receive their registered phone number as the initial password. `initializeUserCredentials` marks the record for a mandatory first-login password change when a phone number is present. The new password must be at least eight characters and cannot equal the phone number.

### Mobile permissions

Team User location assignment supports multiple site checkboxes in both Add and Edit. **All sites** selects every listed site; clearing an individual checkbox excludes it. The selection is stored as normalized site names separated by ` | ` in `site` (and mirrored in `location` by the form), preserving existing single-site records. All sites is a selection of the current list, so newly added sites require assignment. At least one site is required in the form. Live server checks use `userSiteScope` for requests, equipment, request creation and updates, MIS evidence and verification, and team tickets; stale manager report settings never widen Team User scope. Multi-site users select one assigned site when creating a ticket. Role and menu permissions still apply within the assigned sites.

**General User** is available under **Team User** when adding or editing Users & employees. Its desktop and mobile selectors offer **Dashboard**, **Directory (CD)**, **Masters**, **WhatsApp Integration**, **Requests**, **Reports**, **Audit Trail**, and **Tickets**, with every menu unticked by default. Saved selections, including an empty selection, are retained. Switching another role to General User starts with the empty General User defaults. General User never receives request creation, editing, deletion, closure, or verification permissions. The API checks the union of the configured desktop/mobile menus; dashboard data uses `GET /api/requests?scope=dashboard` and remains site-scoped.

**Directory (CD)** is an optional desktop/mobile menu for every account type. It is never required or selected by default; an administrator must explicitly tick it for each view. Deployment migration `directory_cd_opt_in_v1` removes the former automatic CD selection from existing user records without changing their other menus.


| Mobile role | Request visibility | Create | Edit | Delete | Close | Verify / first trip | Equipment master |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Production User | Own requests | Yes | No | No | No | No | Read |
| Maintenance User | All requests | No | Yes when `edit` is granted | Yes when `delete` is granted | Yes | No | No |
| MIS User | Closed requests awaiting verification | No | No | No | No | Yes when `verify` is granted | No |
| Super User | All records | Administrative access | Administrative access | Administrative access | Administrative access | Administrative access | Full access |

The UI hides actions that the session does not expose, but the API repeats these checks. Direct browser or API calls cannot elevate a mobile user’s role.

## 6. Super User navigation and master flow

The Super User top bar contains:

- Dashboard;
- Masters menu;
- WhatsApp Integration menu;
- Users & employees is inside Masters;
- Reports;
- Audit Trail;
- day/night theme toggle.

The current Masters entries are Equipment master, Breakdown master, Repair type master, Region master, Vehicle transfers, Hierarchy master, OEM master, Users & employees, and Privilege.

Every generic master supports:

- live loading state;
- search and sortable columns;
- manual Add record form;
- CSV import with template download and drag-and-drop dropzone;
- CSV export;
- Delete all;
- Equipment Master-only filtered deletion with a complete record review, Audit Trail reason, and explicit confirmation;
- row edit and delete where the page exposes actions.

Import behavior is master-specific:

- Users & employees rows get initial credential fields server-side. Incomplete employee-only rows can be stored, while application users without a phone cannot log in until completed.
- Equipment rows use `equipmentIdentity` to update an existing matching row instead of inserting a duplicate.
- Privilege rows are matched by normalized username and duplicate rows are merged safely.
- Large imports are split into batches of 250 in the browser helper.
- CSV headers can use either field keys or displayed labels. Equipment import includes aliases for legacy location, acquired date, chassis, and manufacturer-serial headings.

### Equipment master fields

The current equipment form and table use current location, equipment name, equipment category, equipment group, item name, item specification name, acquisition date, make, model, manufacturer serial number, engine number, chassis number, document status, asset number, and equipment status. Equipment rows also expose edit and delete actions.

### Privilege master fields

Privilege rows are linked to usernames from Users & employees and contain User Group, Super User/Mobile User selection, site selection, and Read, Edit, Delete, Verify, and Print flags. Changes are made inline and saved with the single Save all button in the page header.

## 7. Production request flow

~~~mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant P as Production User
  participant UI as Mobile request form
  participant API as Express API
  participant DB as PostgreSQL
  P->>UI: Choose Equipment group
  UI->>API: Load Equipment master
  P->>UI: Select equipment / door number
  UI->>API: Check for an active request on the door or chassis
  API-->>UI: Block immediately when the asset is already off road / under maintenance
  P->>UI: Enter date, time, complaint
  UI->>API: POST /api/requests
  API->>DB: Repeat the active-request conflict check
  API->>DB: Insert Open request with session owner/login
  DB-->>API: Saved request projection
  API-->>UI: Request row
~~~

The first selector in Create Request is **Equipment group**. It displays the Equipment master `group` value and uses the database record ID internally. Selecting a group still fills the matching door, registration, and site values. The request payload keeps the existing `equipment` key for compatibility.

After an equipment or vehicle is selected, the form checks `GET /api/requests/conflict` by normalized door number and chassis. Any request whose status is not `Closed` blocks the form, identifies the existing request in a popup and inline warning, and disables submission. `POST /api/requests` repeats the same check and has no duplicate override, so Production and Maintenance users cannot create a second active request for the same asset.

While submission is in progress, the form pauses background conflict checks and ignores late check responses so a refresh cannot flag the newly created request as its own duplicate. Repeated submit events are blocked immediately. The request list adds the server-confirmed row after a successful POST, and the form closes without waiting for another list refresh. The API acknowledges the committed database transaction before running opening reports and notifications; delivery failures are logged without changing the successful creation response.

The form also supports manual 24-hour `HH:MM:SS` time entry and speech-to-text complaint input in supported Chrome/Edge browsers. The mobile submitted table shows Job reference, Equipment group, Door number, Site location, Days of breakdown, and the existing request fields. Days are calculated from the stored start timestamp and are not a separate database parameter.

## 8. Maintenance and MIS workflow

  Maint --> Closed[Closed with closing time and maintenance work]
  Closed --> MIS[MIS User verifies closed request]
  MIS --> Verified[Verified, optional first-trip date/time]
~~~

### Maintenance User

- Requests tab lists requests with edit and delete actions according to the assigned Privilege flags.
- After maintenance accepts a request, every dashboard, request table, filter, export and report derives the visible lifecycle from the recorded timestamps: `Accepted` after acceptance and `In progress` after work starts. A stale stored `Open` value must not be displayed once either event has been recorded.
- Maintenance can set the initial ETC and revise that ETC only once. The edit form locks the ETC controls after the revision, and the API enforces the same rule atomically so concurrent or older clients cannot make a second change. Saving an unchanged ETC does not consume the allowance. Existing user ETC-correction audit history is backfilled into the lock marker at startup.
- Close request form links back to the original request and captures closing date, closing time, maintenance work, and status.
- Tippers capture separate HMR and KMR readings at opening and closing. Edit request has one shared **Trip card upload** for the opening readings; Close request has one shared **Trip card upload** for the closing readings. Existing single-meter readings remain associated with their original meter, and missing opening readings can still be filled at closure. Closing readings and uploads remain optional for maintenance updates.
- Request projections include `openingMeterReadings` and `closingMeterReadings` maps keyed by `HMR`/`KMR`, stored in additive JSONB columns. The single `openingMeterReading`/`closingMeterReading` and `meterType` fields remain compatible with older requests and clients. MIS verification pre-fills saved closing readings and preserves the closing trip card.

### Controlled request corrections

Lifecycle records are never edited directly after an entry error. The responsible operational user opens **Request correction**: Production User can request a correction to their own Off Road entry, Maintenance User can request Maintenance acceptance or On Road correction, and MIS User can request MIS verification correction. The user proposes only allow-listed field changes, explains the reason, and attaches a mandatory JPG, PNG, or WebP evidence image. The live maintenance request remains unchanged while the correction is pending.

Project Managers and Production Managers receive an in-app notification and use **Correction approvals** in their manager profile. A manager can approve or reject only corrections belonging to an assigned site, and must record a review remark. Approval does not change the request by itself: it unlocks **Apply approved correction** under **Admin > Request corrections** for Admin and Super Admin. Application re-checks that the original fields have not changed, validates the complete lifecycle timestamp order, updates the request in one database transaction, records timeline corrections, and writes user submission, PM review, and Admin application events to the Audit Trail. Rejected, stale, and unapproved corrections never alter the source request.
- Closed or verified requests cannot be edited through the edit route.
- Delete is a server-side operation and cannot remove a verified request.

### MIS User

- Verify closed requests lists only closed requests that are not already verified.
- Verify form shows the original equipment, door, registration, site, closure, and maintenance details.
- The First trip done checkbox reveals date and `HH:MM:SS` fields.
- Verification is accepted only for an unverified request with status `Closed`.

## 9. Dashboard and reports

Every report tab shows From and To date fields beside the Filter button. These apply inclusive full-day IST ranges immediately, using the same shared report state as the popup. Selecting the first date initializes both ends; clearing either field or choosing Clear dates restores All dates. The Filter popup retains presets and precise time selection, and its applied dates appear in the visible fields. Editing a visible date selects full days again.

Info Pulse breakdown rows include a **Daily updates** button with the saved entry count. It expands a read-only history beneath that row, newest first, showing maintenance notes, delay reasons, author, and IST timestamp. Refresh uses the latest request history; requests without entries show an explicit empty state.

**Ticket Acceptance from Maintenance (Timelinewise)** defaults to entries whose recorded maintenance acceptance is more than 30 minutes after production submission; exactly 30 minutes is excluded. **Show total** restores all entries, including unaccepted requests, and manual PDF, Excel, print, and ZIP exports follow the selected view. Missing, invalid, or reversed timestamps are excluded from the delay view. Submission uses `start`, falling back to `createdAt`. Selecting this report in a role or personal WhatsApp schedule includes the same over-30-minute delay report within the recipient's permitted site and reporting window; the screen toggle does not change scheduled delivery.

**Actions → Columns** supports named table layouts: save the displayed columns in their current order, rename or update a selected layout, delete it, or restore the default columns. Choose a layout in the column dialog and press **Apply**, or select it from the table toolbar's **Layout** dropdown to apply it immediately. Saving a layout does not apply a draft until Apply is chosen; Cancel discards unapplied column edits. Layouts are scoped to the signed-in account and table/column set in this browser, independently of Smart Print layouts and saved report views. They retain column visibility and order; switching layouts leaves filters, sort and date selections unchanged. Resetting a table keeps its named layouts. Shared tables continue to remember the applied column arrangement across refreshes.

Tables with a breakdown-days or elapsed-time column start with **Highest to lowest time taken** selected. Days of breakdown is the primary sort when more than one duration is present; otherwise the first duration column is used. This includes operational workspaces, dashboard and OEM drilldowns, duration reports, and Audit Trail duration. Sorting uses the underlying elapsed time, so equal displayed day counts still order by minutes and missing durations stay last. Users can select lowest-to-highest, another column, or Clear sort; filtering and live row updates retain that choice. Reset table/report restores the descending duration default.

The dashboard opens in **OEM BD**, site-wise across all permitted WCL and NCL sites. Region, Site, From/To, and OEM remain visible while scrolling and in the OEM/full-fleet detail dialog. The Site filter is available for All regions as well. A chart segment sets the corresponding Region, Site, and OEM filters; a site total keeps the selected OEM. OEM legend entries set OEM, while **All total breakdown** and **View full list** retain every current header filter. Changing a header filter updates the chart, open list, title, and counts together, and resets the list's local search/category/group/status filters. Zero-result selections remain empty. Reset restores all permitted regions/sites/OEMs and today's live breakdown view.

Fleet view labels change the chart; the bold count buttons open their matching records. Blank chart/card areas and headings do not open lists. Total shows the current fleet for the selected location/OEM, while OEM breakdown dates include requests overlapping the chosen interval. Counts represent distinct assets; the detail context separately reports request records when an asset has multiple requests. The full list contains a separate table for each matching site, headed by its region, site name, and record count. The repeated Site column is omitted. Each site supports sorting, filtering, print, and export, with row numbers starting at 1 in the displayed order. OEM names appear inside segments with sufficient space; hover or keyboard focus exposes the name, color, site, and exact count for every segment, including small ones.


**Tracking Vehicle Throughput** starts with empty dates and an **All time** period. Selecting either date initially selects that single day; the From/To controls can then extend the inclusive range. Clearing either date or clicking **Reset dates** clears both dates and restores full-history BD movement and live availability, independently of the top-level dashboard date. The panel's Region filter reveals a Site filter limited to that region's authorized sites; changing or clearing Region resets Site. These selections apply to BD totals, the type mix, site tables, availability counts, exports, and linked detail lists. Dated availability is the fleet snapshot at the end of the selected To day (live when To is today). Opening an all-time site's day-wise details starts at its earliest recorded request, without truncating history to one year.

Info Pulse opens as four KPI cards over a single ranked list. BD balance (selected by default) counts every open request in the user's scope that is not idle, closed or verified, once; Critical counts those standing 24 hours or more, Warning those standing 12 to 24 hours, and Open those under 12 hours. Clicking a card narrows the list to that tier and the three tiers add up to the balance. Production users, Production Managers, Admins, and Super Admins also see a fifth **First trip pending** card for vehicles/equipment made on road by Maintenance and still awaiting the Production first-trip entry; other operational roles and non-production managers do not see it. Rows are tinted red, amber or purple by tier. The Filters panel opens collapsed on every screen with a purple blinking border and a "Customise yourself" cue for three seconds (no animation under reduced motion); Show filters expands it. Filters mirror the dashboard record browser: region tabs (WCL/NCL, shown when the scope spans more than one region), Site chips (shown for multi-site scopes) and Equipment / Vehicle chips (KMR requests are vehicles, HMR equipment, older requests classified by group name), each counted within its parent, plus an inclusive Started From/To range in IST with Until today, Today, 7D/14D/30D and All dates presets. The range defaults to Until today (no From, To = today): the BD balance as of now, every open breakdown started on or before today, undated requests included. Reset selection restores that default and every region. The KPI counts, list, record count and captions follow these filters. There is no pagination or drill-down. Rows run longest standing first and show the site, door/registration, equipment group and reference, status, the breakdown reason (with the recorded delay reason beneath it when one exists: the ETC overdue reason, else the latest daily-update delay reason, else the closure delay reason), standing since, down-for time (with a bar relative to the longest-standing breakdown) and the ETC, flagged as overdue or due in. The header trigger badge shows the same BD balance. Existing server-side site scope remains in force. The feed refreshes on request changes and every 30 seconds, displays its last successful refresh time, and distinguishes loading or failed refreshes from a zero balance. Existing impossible same-day AM ETC values that precede the breakdown are interpreted as their PM counterpart only when that 12-hour correction falls after the breakdown; new ETC changes must be later than the server's current time. The existing login-only one-minute display and manual reopening remain unchanged.

Info Pulse's toolbar has an **Export** menu beside Refresh, the same menu as the report tables: Download as PDF, Download as Excel and Smart Print (choose and save the columns to print). It covers every breakdown in the current selection, the selected KPI tier plus the region, site, equipment/vehicle and started-date filters, not only the rows rendered so far, in the same longest-standing-first order with a serial number. The columns are site, equipment/vehicle, equipment group, request ref, status, standing tier, breakdown reason, delay reason (overdue and closure reasons keep their label) with when and by whom it was recorded, standing since, down for, ETC and its overdue/due state, the daily-update count and the latest daily update. The report title carries the tier, place and date captions. The menu and the preparing-file overlay sit above the full-screen panel.

Each Fleet control dashboard section has its own **Export** menu in its header: Download as PDF, Download as Excel and Smart Print. **Smart Print prints the section exactly as it looks on screen**, chart and figures in the screen's Day or Night palette, with the usual paper, printer, pages, sides and copies and no columns to choose. PDF and Excel export the figures that section shows as a table, following that section's own view and filters, and the title names the section, place and period. **Total Fleet** lists every site bar (equipment, vehicles, total fleet, equipment and vehicle breakdowns, BD balance, BD %), each region total and the dashboard total, with a row for fleet whose location matches no chart site so the columns add up; in OEM BD mode it lists each site's breakdowns per OEM with site, region and overall totals. **Daily BD balance** lists each day (opening, BD In, BD Out, closing, idle, net change and change %) and, over more than one day, the selected-period totals. **Tracking Vehicle Throughput** follows its open tab: Site-wise BD Movement exports the site table with its availability count impact, the all-sites total, the four summary cards (whose BD Balance leaves idle out and whose Idle Vehicles counts idle requests) and the BD Type Mix; Availability Count exports the site table and total. **Request Lifecycle** lists the six grouped bars per day and the summary cards. **Breakdown trend** lists each day's recorded breakdowns with a running total and the gap to the daily baseline, then the Recorded and Daily baseline cards. The menus appear once fleet data has loaded, are left out of the whole-dashboard PDF capture and of printed pages, and follow Night mode.

The whole Fleet control dashboard has an **Export dashboard** menu in its banner, and the same menu stays beside the eye toggle when the banner is collapsed. Download as PDF and Smart Print capture the whole dashboard as it is on screen. Download as Excel gives one workbook with a sheet for the KPIs and one per section: Total Fleet (or OEM BD in that view), Daily BD balance as currently shown, both Tracking Vehicle Throughput tabs (BD Movement and Availability Count), Request Lifecycle and Breakdown trend. In the OEM BD view the workbook has the KPIs and the OEM table only.

The Super User dashboard is the mining-operations view. It loads Equipment master, Users & employees, Repair type master, and request data, then derives:

- top-row repair-type cards from the configured Repair type master;
- equipment totals and availability from `dashboard-equipment-metrics.mjs`;
- status counts for operational, maintenance, and breakdown equipment;
- region bars from the current WCL/NCL site list;
- fleet composition by Equipment group, category, or item name;
- request workload by status;
- user totals and a Mobile/Super/Admin drilldown;
- recent breakdown cases.

Reports include request-age highlighting. The shared styles mark requests about one day old yellow, two to four days orange, and more than five days red. The Reports and request tables use the same stored request start time as the Mobile days-of-breakdown value.

The General Report tab also carries the **In and Out Report**, the tabular twin of the dashboard Request Lifecycle graph. `in-out-report.mjs` builds one row per IST calendar day (from the earliest workflow event, capped at 366 days) with vehicles in (opened), vehicles out (maintenance closed, idle excluded), MIS verified, idle vehicles, net movement, the balance still in workshop and awaiting MIS verification at day end, average closure turnaround, and the vehicle and location lists behind each movement. The same module feeds the director bundle (`DIRECTOR_REPORT_TITLES[13]`, General department) and the daily 7 PM operational schedule, so the report can be scheduled, emailed, and downloaded in the reports ZIP like every other report.

## 10. WhatsApp Integration

The WhatsApp Integration menu contains:

1. **Daily site-wise report**: site rows with report-level checkboxes. Selecting a site/report prepares an alert for the selected recipient.
2. **Daily OEM report**: OEM rows with daily and L1/L2/L3/L4 selections, plus WCL/NCL filtering where configured.
3. **WhatsApp alert history**: the last 1,000 prepared alerts, including report type, target, level, recipient, phone, status, and timestamp.

The current implementation prepares and records alerts. The history is stored in `whatsapp_alert_history` and is protected by the Super User guard.

| POST | `/api/whatsapp-alert-history` | Super User | Record a prepared alert |

Request projections expose the compatibility keys `ref`, `equipment`, `door`, `reg`, `site`, `category`, `complaint`, `start`, `hours`, `status`, `owner`, `requesterLogin`, `closedAt`, `closedBy`, `maintenanceWork`, `verificationStatus`, `verifiedAt`, `verifiedBy`, `firstTripDone`, `firstTripAt`, and `firstTripBy`.

## 12. PostgreSQL data model

`server.mjs` runs idempotent migrations at startup. The main tables are:

- `master_records`: one JSONB row per master record, keyed by `master_name`.
- `maintenance_requests`: request identity, equipment, location, complaint, start/status, closure, verification, first-trip fields, and the `expected_completion_changed_at` marker that enforces one ETC revision per request.
- `auth_sessions`: active bearer sessions and resolved permissions.
- `password_change_sessions`: short-lived mandatory initial-password sessions.
- `app_metadata`: UI-version session invalidation and repair-type seed markers.
- `whatsapp_alert_history`: prepared WhatsApp report history.

The database connection uses `DATABASE_URL` and SSL with certificate verification disabled for the configured Azure PostgreSQL connection. Keep this variable in Azure App Service configuration or a local secret store. Never commit it.

## 13. CI/CD and Azure deployment

The dashboard's Daily BD balance panel offers **View → Every site BD balance**. Choose **All sites** and a From/To period to compare daily closing BD in a grid of site bar charts, including zero-balance sites. Every chart uses the same scale and each bar opens the matching site/date requests. Zero-balance days remain clickable. Period opening, incoming, outgoing, closing and idle counts appear below each graph. Long ranges scroll horizontally within each site graph. Site, region and Shift Master filters continue to apply. Counts open the matching requests for that site and date or period. Smart Export and the dashboard workbook include the site name, daily movements and each site's period totals. **Daily movement chart** restores the combined or single-site chart.

The tracked GitHub workflows run on pushes to `azure-hosting` or `azure-hosting-1.0` and on manual dispatch:

1. Checkout the repository.
2. Install Node.js 22 with npm cache.
3. Run `npm ci`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
4. Upload the built repository as an artifact.
5. Log in to Azure using GitHub federated credentials stored as repository secrets.
6. Deploy the artifact to App Service `coalmine-fleet-azure-783` in the Production slot.

`npm run build` creates a new random `APP_VERSION`, builds the frontend to `dist`, writes `dist/app-version.txt`, and writes the static hosting metadata under `dist/.openai`. The server reads the version file and clears all active sessions when it changes.

### Safe release checklist

~~~powershell
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
git diff --check
git status --short
~~~

Commit only intentional source, test, documentation, and workflow files. Do not add `node_modules`, `dist`, deployment ZIPs, `.azure-cli`, or historical `azure-*` folders. Push the branch used by the configured GitHub workflow, then verify:

~~~powershell
Invoke-WebRequest https://bdms.cmll.in/api/health | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
~~~

Expected health output contains `"status":"ok"` and `"database":"connected"`.

## 14. Troubleshooting

### Valid login fails with a duplicate session public ID

Reverting the System Administration feature left `auth_sessions.session_public_id` and its unique index in databases where that feature had run. Its old empty-string default makes a second session fail with PostgreSQL `23505` on `auth_sessions_public_id_idx`.

Startup calls `repairLegacySessionDefaults` to set `gen_random_uuid()::text` as the default only when that legacy column exists. Existing sessions, identifiers, permissions, and the unique index are preserved. Fresh databases without the column continue to work. Do not resolve this error by clearing sessions or removing uniqueness.

`test/auth-session-schema.test.mjs` runs a real PostgreSQL regression when `AUTH_SESSION_TEST_DATABASE_URL` is configured (`AUTH_SESSION_TEST_DATABASE_SSL=false` for local PostgreSQL). It uses a temporary table inside a rolled-back transaction, reproduces the legacy failure, and verifies repeat sign-ins, existing-session continuity, and idempotent repair. The Azure build runs it against an isolated PostgreSQL service.

### Login says the account is duplicated

Make the Login name unique in Users & employees for the selected access type. The server rejects ambiguous matches instead of choosing an account at random.

### Mobile login says no assigned role

Set the user’s User type to Mobile User, then set User Group in Privilege to exactly Production User, Maintenance User, or MIS User. Save all privilege changes and sign in again.

### The app shows a server error after deployment

Check `/api/health`, Azure App Service Log Stream, and the GitHub Actions build log. A build can succeed while database initialization is still retrying. Confirm `DATABASE_URL` is present and the PostgreSQL firewall allows the App Service.

Since the transient-failure hardening the app no longer answers a bare `Server error`:

- `server-error-response.mjs` turns database connection drops (PostgreSQL restarts, slot swaps, `ECONNRESET`, SQLSTATE classes 08/57/53/40) into HTTP 503 with `Retry-After: 5` and the message "The server is reconnecting to the database. Please retry in a moment." Route errors that carry a status keep that status and message; anything else is a 500 whose message tells the user to retry or contact the administrator. Every 500 is logged with its method and URL, so search the Log Stream for `[500]`.
- `pool.on('error')` and `process.on('unhandledRejection')` keep the process alive when an idle database connection breaks; before this a single dropped idle connection exited Node and every user saw errors until App Service restarted the container.
- `src/api-transient-retry.mjs` makes the browser wait and retry read-only `/api/` requests that receive 408/425/429/502/503/504 or a dropped connection (about 19 seconds across five attempts, honouring `Retry-After`). Writes are never replayed. A message still reaches the user only when the outage outlasts the retry window.

If a user still reports a server error, the Log Stream line tagged `[500]` names the failing route and stack; fix that route and add a regression test.

### A newly deployed UI is not visible

The browser checks `/api/app-version` and should log out and reload automatically. If a stale tab remains, open the site again and confirm the response headers are not serving an old deployment.

### CSV import fails

Download the master’s CSV template, keep the first row as headings, save as UTF-8 CSV, and import in smaller batches if the file is large. Equipment imports upsert on identity; the same equipment should update rather than create a duplicate row.

### The site loads but no master data appears

Check the authenticated request in the browser network panel and `/api/health`. Super User master APIs require a valid session. Mobile users can only load Equipment master when their role profile grants equipment access.

## 15. Change map for future maintainers

When changing a feature, update the matching source, focused test, and this file if the public flow, role rule, API, database field, or deployment path changes. Run the release checklist before pushing. A change to the UI version is intentional: it forces active sessions to reload so users receive the same interface and permission model.

## 16. Unified WhatsApp delivery and report settings

**Reports → WhatsApp delivery settings** is the central Admin / Super Admin panel for organisation-wide routing, delivery switches, reminders, CRM fallback timing and message templates. It links to **Role default schedules** and **My report schedule**. Every eligible signed-in user, including Admin and Super Admin, also opens **Reports → My report schedule** directly. The separate Admin-menu Report Setting entry and duplicate Hierarchy Master timing editor are removed. Hierarchy Master retains report assignments and site access, with a link back to Reports for timing.

Settings and template-management requests re-resolve the signed-in user's current Users & employees / Privilege profile; a stale administrator session does not grant settings access after demotion. Provider setup and delivery history remain under **WhatsApp Integration → Meta API setup / WhatsApp alert history**.

### Recipient policy and CRM privacy

| Audience | Immediate request alerts, reminders and daily updates | CRM ticket-created / resolved alerts | Scheduled reports |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Production, Maintenance and MIS operational users | All four request-status events and daily maintenance updates at the same assigned site by default, across request categories | Their own tickets only | Assigned fleet reports using their role or personal schedule |
| Managers, including Project / department managers, and Directors | Hard-excluded | Hard-excluded | Reports only, within authorised sites; manager CRM reports include all ticket categories at those sites |
| Admin and Super Admin | Hard-excluded | Hard-excluded | All fleet reports in fresh role defaults, plus CRM reports; saved report selections and schedules remain effective |

The four request-status events are **Opened / Off Road**, **Closed / On Road**, **MIS Verified** and **Marked Idle**. Their default recipient roles are Production supervisor, Maintenance supervisor and MIS supervisor. Operational recipients must match the request's canonical assigned site. Admin, Super Admin, Manager and Director accounts are reports-only and cannot be selected for these immediate alerts or their reminders. A saved WhatsApp number is required, and delivery still obeys the global and message-purpose switches.

Leadership exclusion is enforced in recipient selection and again at immediate delivery; old role selections, generic CRM/daily-update calls and duplicate-login records cannot opt Admin, Super Admin, Manager or Director accounts back in. Classification uses `whatsAppRecipientRole()` rather than treating the legacy Super User account type as Super Admin. Manager/Director job or recognised Director-name classification takes priority over a legacy Admin fallback; a real Super Admin authority remains reports-only for WhatsApp operational events.

**CRM alerts stay private:** ticket creation and resolution notify the operational ticket owner only, not leadership or every operational user at the site. Scheduled Admin, Super Admin and manager CRM reports have a separate authorised-site audience and include all CRM categories, without filtering by the creator's department. This reporting rule does not broaden interactive CRM ticket access. WhatsApp audience selection is separate from the existing in-app notification recipients.

### Delivery controls and defaults

| Control | Default / behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| All WhatsApp delivery | On; covers alerts, reminders, reports, manual sends and password reset OTPs |
| Message types | Scheduled fleet reports, CRM-created/resolved alerts, daily updates, manual reports and OTPs enabled |
| Direct alerts | All four events enabled for the default operational and administrator roles; Manager / Director are not selectable |
| Off Road escalation | One escalation after four hours; configurable from 1–168 hours, using Opened recipients |
| Idle reminder | Repeats hourly; configurable from 1–24 hours, using Marked Idle recipients |
| Quiet hours | Off; editable daily IST window initially 22:00–07:00 |
| Scheduled CRM reports | On; Admin, Manager and Super Admin account types; include empty site reports by default |
| CRM fallback timetable | Every day at 08:00, 15:00 and 20:00 IST; up to six times; applies only when that user has no applicable saved personal schedule |
| Report files | Site-specific PDF and XLSX download links, valid for 14 days |

Turning off Opened or Idle also pauses its corresponding reminder. Existing overdue requests may qualify on the next reminder check after an interval change. Quiet hours suppress non-OTP delivery; immediate event alerts are not queued, while an overdue reminder may qualify later. The global switch also blocks OTPs. Scheduled jobs check every minute while background jobs are running and use a 20-minute delivery grace period; this is not an unlimited replay of missed deliveries. Messages already handed to the provider cannot be recalled.

### Role defaults, My report schedule and legacy timing

| Scope | UI entry | Storage and API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Organisation role defaults, Admin / Super Admin only | **Reports → WhatsApp delivery settings → Role default schedules** | `app_settings` key `hierarchy_report_schedules`; `GET /api/report-schedule-settings` and `PUT` with `{designations: ...}` |
| Own personal schedule, including administrators | **Reports → My report schedule**, or the link inside delivery settings | `app_settings` key `hierarchy_report_schedule:user:<login>`; `GET /api/report-schedule-settings?scope=personal` and `PUT` at the same URL with `{userSchedule}` |
| Return to defaults | **My report schedule → Use role default** | `PUT /api/report-schedule-settings?scope=personal` with `{resetToDefault: true}` deletes only that login's personal copy |

The explicit `?scope=personal` is essential for administrators: it selects their own schedule instead of editing the organisation's role defaults. The response includes `canManageAll`, permitted designations/reports, `userName`, `userLogin` and `userSchedule`; the latter is null when no personal copy is saved.

Users can select Daily, Weekly or Every N days, edit IST minute slots, add/delete rows and choose from reports assigned to their role. An active row requires a time and a report. Unsupported report selections are dropped on save. Explicit cadence wins over stale weekday/interval fields. The existing Every N days rule remains calendar-based: days N, 2N, etc. of each month; its previous occurrence can therefore be more or less than N days away across a month boundary.

Existing role and personal timings are retained. Before a role is saved centrally, legacy Hierarchy Master `scheduleDays` / `scheduleTimes` are applied and shown as the **effective** role timetable. Saving role defaults marks submitted designations `managedByReportSettings: true`; subsequent delivery uses those central timings instead of legacy Hierarchy Master timing. Hierarchy report assignments and site restrictions continue to apply. Editing a report/site tick in Hierarchy Master is not a second timing editor.

A matching personal schedule replaces the role timetable for that login only. The role Active switch still gates that personal schedule, and recipient/report/site restrictions still apply. Saved personal schedules under a different designation are ignored. Saving one user's schedule never changes another user's timing or the shared role default; removing a report or slot from a saved list does not automatically restore General Reports at 19:00.

For **fleet reports**, use the effective role timetable unless a matching personal schedule replaces it. For **CRM**, a matching saved personal schedule supplies that user's delivery slots and takes priority over the organisation CRM fallback. With no applicable personal copy, CRM uses `crm.days` / `crm.times` (08:00 / 15:00 / 20:00 by default), independently of the role's fleet timetable. A paused or empty applicable personal schedule does not silently fall back to global CRM times. Global CRM controls and authorised-site/account-type checks still apply. Resetting one user's personal schedule restores fleet role defaults and CRM fallback timing for that user only.

**Reports are timed only.** Every event is no longer a selectable frequency, `reportsForHierarchyEvent()` returns no reports, and event-driven sender entry points skip publication. Normalisation folds legacy event-selected report titles into an existing active timed row without changing that row's days or times. Event-only personal copies can inherit current role timing; disabled selections remain disabled, and explicitly paused/empty role timing is not reactivated. Unplaced selections are retained in paused rows for later editing. Removing the UI option alone is not the delivery guard.

### Reporting windows, complete activity and site bundles

For each due delivery, use `[previous scheduled occurrence, current scheduled occurrence)` in IST. The previous occurrence is determined across **all active report rows in the user's effective personal/role timetable**, not independently per row. For example, with one active row at 08:00 and another at 15:00, the 15:00 delivery covers 08:00–15:00 rather than starting at yesterday's 15:00. Rows due at the same occurrence contribute to the same window and their report selections are combined. The end is the scheduled time, not the delayed scheduler run time or the last successful send. Daily minute slots, weekly days and existing calendar intervals must use their actual previous occurrence across midnight, weekends and month boundaries. CRM without a personal schedule uses adjacent occurrences of its fallback timetable.

The activity window is inclusive at the start and exclusive at the end. Activity exactly at a slot boundary belongs to the next window. Include **every case with activity in the window**, even if it opened and closed during that same window; do not use only the current open backlog or discard an opening because the case has since closed.

- Fleet activity includes opening, maintenance acceptance, closure, MIS verification, Idle marking, Idle approval / On Road, first-trip verification and timestamped daily maintenance remarks. Older cases qualify when they have new activity in the window. Cases with no window activity are not repeated as backlog.
- The fleet bundle starts with **All request activity in this window**, then the selected non-empty report tables. The complete activity table prevents status-specific report views from hiding a case that changed status several times. Lifecycle fields are bounded to the window end; fleet master totals in selected reference tables remain current snapshots rather than a historical event ledger.
- CRM includes tickets created or resolved in the window. A ticket created and resolved within the window remains included once with its timestamps. A later resolution must not make an earlier window report the ticket as already resolved.

Fleet and CRM publish **separate bundles for each authorised site and delivery window**. Each fleet site bundle has one PDF containing its report sections and one XLSX workbook containing the corresponding sheets; CRM similarly publishes one PDF and XLSX for that site's ticket activity. Each recipient receives one consolidated WhatsApp message per report family and scheduled window, covering all their selected permitted locations. The message has a bold LOCATIONS heading, the IST window, per-site counts and site-labelled PDF and Excel links. There is no Notes field or extra notes paragraph. Both files are stored in `published_reports` and linked through `/r/<short_code>` for **14 days**. Full case details stay inside the files. No combined multi-site file is substituted for the site-specific links.

Recipient site scope is resolved before publication and intersected with applicable hierarchy restrictions. Managers without an authorised site/region are skipped; a hierarchy row cannot broaden their access. Dispatch claims in `whatsapp_consolidated_report_runs` are scoped by occurrence and recipient (plus the report family/flow/schedule identity), covering all selected locations in one send, and delivery outcomes are recorded in `whatsapp_alert_history`. Repeated scheduler polls deduplicate claims; failed report attempts may retry up to three attempts within the eligible delivery window.

Scheduled Availability Report figures use the exact delivery window, including downtime carried over from incidents already open at the start. Those incidents contribute to interval availability without being repeated as new case activity. Manual month-to-date availability reports retain their existing behavior.

### Version-3 policy migration, reset and persistence

Settings are stored under `app_settings` key `whatsapp_report_settings`. `normalizeWhatsAppReportSettings()` upgrades settings to **version 3**. Pre-version-2 records receive the unified operational defaults. Version-2 records retain valid operational/OEM selections while Admin and Super Admin are removed from immediate-event recipient lists. Scheduled CRM recipients remain unchanged.

The routing migration preserves saved global/event delivery pauses, reminder settings, CRM days/times and empty-report preference, quiet hours, template choices and version-2 channel switches. Role/personal schedules have their separate timed-only normalisation described above. Once version 3 is saved, permitted custom role selections and explicitly disabled generic channels are retained; all leadership immediate-alert exclusions remain enforced. Legacy CRM summary-only/PDF-only/combined formats normalise to linked PDF and XLSX files.

**Reset delivery rules** loads default delivery rules into the draft while preserving existing CRM days/times and all message-template choices; role and personal schedules are stored separately and remain intact. Other delivery controls return to defaults, including delivery switches and reminder/quiet-hour settings. **Save settings** applies that draft. This action is separate from **Use role default**, which removes only the current user's personal schedule.

Delivery-settings saves check `{settings, revision}` under a database advisory lock and return HTTP 409 for a stale revision. Settings writes and template actions are audited. The shared Meta/Fast2SMS sending layer reads the current policy before sending, including a second check after PDF upload; settings read failures cannot bypass the global pause. No settings-panel endpoint sends a WhatsApp test message.

### Provider setup and template purposes

Provider credentials remain under `app_settings` key `meta_whatsapp`, separate from delivery settings; server-held approval snapshots use `whatsapp_template_approvals`. The panel endpoints are `GET /api/report-settings`, `PUT /api/report-settings` with `{settings, revision}`, and `POST /api/report-settings/templates` with `{action: "submit" | "refresh"}`.

To activate wording: choose a purpose and sample/custom text, **Save settings**, **Submit saved template choices**, then **Refresh approval status**. New variants use names derived from purpose and content, preserving existing provider templates. Custom text is limited to 1,024 characters and must retain all numbered placeholders exactly once and in order. Saved wording becomes effective only after its provider status is recorded as APPROVED; pending, rejected or paused choices use the existing standard fallback. Selected custom template submission is explicit. Startup submits missing standard definitions and refreshes approval status; deployment does not send sample messages. Authentication OTP wording remains fixed. Previews use sample data and do not change report contents, recipients, permissions or timing.

The gallery retains **ten samples for all 40 purposes (400 samples)**: 28 named reports from `DIRECTOR_REPORT_TITLES` and 12 consolidated, manual, alert and reminder purposes. Styles include Current standard, Compact summary, Structured detail, Executive brief, Action focused, Team handover, Review checklist, Formal notice, Numbered facts / Report review card, and Status card. **Customise this sample** copies the selected wording into the editor; only saved selected templates are submitted.

**Scheduled site fleet bundles always use `consolidatedRequestReport`, even when only one named report is selected.** Scheduled CRM site bundles use `consolidatedTicketReport`. Named single-report choices remain available for legacy/manual single-report use, with `inherit` resolving to the consolidated style and approval; they do not select the scheduled site-bundle purpose or create per-event report delivery. Manual report sends use the separate `manualReports` purpose. Existing standard/compact/structured wording and provider names remain compatible.

If the provider explicitly rejects an unavailable CRM template (132001), a single-site delivery can fall back to one PDF attachment with its links, while a multi-site delivery falls back to one text message containing all site links. Timeouts, suspensions and policy pauses do not trigger an additional send. Scheduled fleet template failures are recorded for retry rather than becoming per-request text reports. Provider delivery can still fail; inspect **WhatsApp alert history** and the provider connection/approval state.

### Implementation and focused verification

- `whatsapp-recipient-policy.mjs`, `whatsapp-workflow-policy.mjs`, `whatsapp-report-settings.mjs`: common classification, hard exclusions, same-site request routing, switches and version-2 migration.
- `hierarchy-report-flow.mjs`, `report-delivery-window.mjs`: timed-only migration, effective role/personal schedules and previous-occurrence windows. `server.mjs` connects `reportScheduleScope()`, `crmReportGroups()`, `combineReportWindowGroups()`, generic alert routing and the scheduled senders.
- `site-consolidated-report.mjs`, `table-export-pdf.mjs`, `director-report-bundle.mjs`: complete window activity, site notices, PDF sections and XLSX sheets; server publishing creates the expiring links.
- `src/main.jsx`, `src/whatsapp-report-settings.jsx` / `.css`: the Reports settings entry, role-default and personal editors, reset behaviour and Hierarchy Master access-only editing.
- `whatsapp-report-settings-api.mjs`, `whatsapp-template-catalog.mjs`, `whatsapp-template-runtime.mjs`, `meta-whatsapp.mjs`: authorisation/revisions, wording/preview, provider approvals and transport-level policy checks.

Relevant tests include `whatsapp-workflow-policy`, `generic-whatsapp-alerts`, `whatsapp-report-settings`, `whatsapp-report-settings-api`, `hierarchy-report-flow`, `hierarchy-event-delivery`, `user-report-schedules`, `hierarchy-report-scope`, `site-consolidated-report`, `whatsapp-report-delivery`, `table-bundle-pdf`, `xlsx-report-bundle`, `whatsapp-delivery-settings-ui`, `admin-menu-access` and `hierarchy-master-ui` under `test/` (`.test.mjs`). Keep coverage for legacy routing migration without timing/template resets, hard manager/director exclusions, private CRM alerts, cross-row adjacent windows, opened-and-closed-in-one-window cases, personal CRM override isolation, site-specific files, administrator personal scope, provider approval fallback and pauses during media upload.


### WhatsApp message layout and template rollout (September 2026)

Operational WhatsApp templates begin with a bold `SITE` heading on its own line. Each template has separate labelled fields so provider parameter whitespace normalization cannot collapse the entire message. The saved request or ticket supplies the equipment, breakdown category, complaint, repair work, delay/idle reason, CRM priority/resolution, timestamps, meter and first-trip status as applicable. Individual notifications and reminders omit the Next step field. Audio-only details point users to the recording in Caliber Pulse; long prose is summarized, with the request link retained.

Scheduled fleet and CRM reports pass structured site, reporting window, activity count and PDF/Excel links. Each scheduled delivery consolidates all selected permitted locations into one message while retaining site-specific files and the exact interval. Manual reports and WhatsApp share text also lead with the site or an explicit multi-site scope. Account password-reset OTPs retain their authentication format.

Manage wording in **Reports → WhatsApp delivery settings → Message templates**. All prepared styles retain the bold site header; new custom wording must retain that header and every required field. Saved older custom bodies remain available for editing and fall back to the new standard until corrected and approved. Changing layouts does not change recipients, pauses, personal schedules or report permissions.

New provider definitions use immutable `*_site_v3` names for individual notifications and `*_locations_v3` names for consolidated reports. Version-2 structured parameters are translated by field name, removing Notes and Next step without shifting retained fields. The original opened-request call and the new layout both contain nine values; callers supplying already-formatted v3 values must set `context.parameterLayout` to `current`. Startup submits missing standard templates and records the provider statuses; a 15-minute read refresh keeps those statuses current. Existing provider definitions remain unchanged. If Meta explicitly reports a new template unavailable (132001), the sender can use the previous approved template with its original parameter contract until the new layout is accepted. Network errors, provider suspensions and application delivery pauses do not trigger that migration retry. Preview availability is separate from provider approval and delivery history should be checked for actual sends.

### Employee tenure report

The C-Dir menu order is Directory, Employee Tenure Report, then C-Dir Masters. C-Dir Masters has moved out of the main Masters menu and keeps its existing edit permissions. The report follows Directory (CD) menu access. Site, region, department, category and designation filters can be combined; exports contain only the filtered rows and identify the selected filters. It reads the live C-Dir employee roster and includes only named ACTIVE employees with at least three completed calendar months of service. Columns are Employee ID, Employee name, Department, Designation, Joining date and Working tenure (for example 3Y 2M 15D). Counted through defaults to today in India and is included in the report/export title. Minimum-service filters offer 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months; each means at least that number of completed months. Former employees, vacancies, future joiners and missing/invalid joining dates are excluded; missing/invalid dates are disclosed as a count. Month-end anniversaries clamp to the last day of the month. The standard report Generate menu provides PDF, Excel and print exports.

### Private C-Dir roster replacements

Approved C-Dir roster replacements can be passed privately through the deployment secret `CDIR_ROSTER_IMPORT_BROTLI_BASE64` (version-1 JSON compressed with Brotli and base64 encoded). Never commit personnel import payloads to source control. The full deployment validates the seven masters, supplies the payload temporarily to production, and verifies the committed SHA-256 revision through `/api/health` before removing the temporary configuration. Remove the deployment secret after the approved import. `cdir-roster-import.mjs` backs up the prior C-Dir rows in the private `cdir_roster_imports` table and replaces only those seven masters in one transaction. The same revision is never applied twice, so later manual edits survive restarts. Directory, tenure reports, filters, exports and birthdays continue to read the live masters. Staging does not apply imports. A recovery operator can restore `previous_records` from the corresponding import revision in a database transaction; unrelated masters and login accounts are outside the replacement scope.

Session policy: all mobile and desktop roles have no inactivity logout. Activity heartbeats update presence only. Sessions retain their existing 30-day maximum lifetime and can still be ended by sign-out, administrator revocation, or account security changes.

Telegram site invitations run in batches of five so large sites do not exceed the HTTP gateway response window. Each recipient is claimed atomically in `app_settings` before contacting Telegram, and the delivery result is saved. Refreshing or continuing skips recorded attempts. Network errors, interrupted sends and failed result persistence remain uncertain and are not automatically resent; explicit provider rejections are shown as failed. Administrators must review these deliveries. The site-group table shows saved invitation counts only for currently assigned connected users. Historical invitations sent before this tracking rollout are not backfilled. Users must tap the private link and request membership; the bot still checks their current site assignment before approval. A counted invitation is not proof of current membership.

### Running BD maintenance handoff

Request polling and report projections omit workflow visit snapshots. Only the authenticated single-request timeline loads `workflowHistory`, stripping legacy embedded audio, photos and trip-card payloads in SQL. New Running BD and reopening snapshots exclude those binary fields; saved originals and earlier snapshots are retained. A bounded, read-only startup measurement records the request count and historical JSON bytes removed from the feed in Audit Trail under **Application performance**. Notification reads retry a PostgreSQL deadlock once; workflow writes are never replayed by that read helper.

Schema setup is fingerprinted independently of the UI version. Staging and production serialize schema installation with a transaction advisory lock, record the fingerprint only after success, and skip unchanged DDL on later restarts. A two-second lock acquisition timeout rolls back blocked migrations for the existing startup retry, preventing them from queueing indefinitely behind live traffic. Version bookkeeping and one-time data seeds still run normally.

Maintenance can choose On road with breakdown (Running BD) alongside normal completion. The vehicle returns to road availability and enters the existing MIS first-trip verification workflow, while its maintenance ticket remains open. Selecting a vehicle with an active ticket requires Same reason or Different reason; both reuse that ticket, and Different reason adds an outstanding issue. Maintenance must mark every recorded issue fixed before final closure or Idle completion. Earlier visits and verification are retained in workflow history. Tracking Vehicle Throughput includes a Running with BD count with the same scoped list drilldown as the other KPIs.

Equipment requests require HMR only for Maintenance Users at opening and closing. KMR remains required for vehicles; saved secondary KMR keys do not turn equipment into a vehicle.

### Admin workshop selected deletion

Admin and Super Admin sessions can select and delete filtered requests in Production, Maintenance, MIS, first-trip, closed-history and Idle tables. Select all filtered covers the complete matching result; the count and review exclude selections hidden by the current filters. The review lists every selected request with equipment, site, status and lifecycle dates and requires an Audit Trail reason before confirmation. Admin deletion includes verified history and Idle records; operational users keep their existing single-record permissions and cannot delete verified or Idle requests. The bulk API removes linked corrections, WhatsApp workflow dispatches and cascading daily remarks in one transaction, locking the selected requests before applying deletion. Equipment Master entries are retained.

### C-Directory visibility

Every signed-in user can browse the complete C-Directory roster through the All tab, including General Users and users at Corporate Office, Nagpur or Head Office, Chandrapur. Office, WCL, NCL and site tabs filter the roster by location. The two primary tabs are All and My Site. All exposes office/WCL/NCL subtabs; My Site starts with all assigned sites selected and exposes individual assigned-site subtabs. Account profiles and operational permissions remain role-specific.

### HR User

Team User includes HR User and HR Manager. Selecting it provides the complete C-Directory, Employee Tenure Report and all C-Dir Masters on desktop and mobile views. HR cannot access unrelated masters or maintenance actions. HR users and HR Managers are exempt from category A contact masking. Only HR users, HR Managers, directors and administrators may edit employee details using the profile edit icon.

### Employee Transfer

C-Directory includes Employee Transfer for HR users, directors, administrators and Project Managers. Employee ID lookup resolves one active C-Dir Employee master record and its contact record; ambiguous IDs or contacts require reconciliation. HR, directors and admins may request from any location; Project Managers may request only from their assigned sites. Each request preserves original and proposed details, source/destination, transfer date, requester, remarks and approval history in the dedicated employee_transfers table, included in the existing full database backup.

Both locations must have an assigned approver. Nagpur and Chandrapur office aliases route to the Team User HR Manager assigned to that office; other sites route to their Project Manager. User location choices include Nagpur and Chandrapur, mapped to the existing corporate/head-office directory records. Request creation and outgoing/incoming bell notifications commit together. Only the source location's assigned approver can approve, followed by the destination location's assigned approver accepting or rejecting. Project Managers cannot approve office requests unless also assigned the HR Manager role for that office. Acceptance atomically updates the employee/contact masters; employee details remain unchanged until then. Changed employee records block acceptance so newer edits cannot be overwritten. Rejections require a reason; duplicate pending requests and repeated acceptance are rejected. Each All, Outgoing, Incoming and History table, employee-detail comparison and approval history uses the shared ReportSection export/PDF/Excel/print controls. Notification clicks resolve a scoped employee transfer target and open the transfer workspace.


### BDMS Assistant screen

BDMS-enabled desktop and mobile headers include BDMS Assistant. Its opening click starts the bilingual welcome audio synchronously; browser playback rejection presents Enable sound. The authenticated dialog uses the existing role/site-scoped chatbot preview endpoint for language selection, menus, detail follow-ups and custom dates. Closing aborts pending requests and pauses audio. Telegram welcome includes a public application link with `?bdmsAssistant=1`; it opens the assistant after normal BDMS sign-in. No Telegram identity is treated as application authentication. Browser restrictions may require one initial sound-enabling tap when opening from Telegram. Accounts and HR profiles are excluded.

Public chatbot entry: https://pulse.cmll.in/join/bdms redirects to the configured Telegram bot with the public bdms start marker. It contains no login or account-link token and grants no request access. New users still connect their own account through Profile -> Connect Telegram. This is a bot chat entry, not a site-group invitation.

### C-Directory deletion approvals

C-Dir → Record Deletion Approvals is available to HR users, HR Managers, directors, admins and Project Managers. Nonadmin employee/contact Master deletion submits an individual approval request and leaves the record in place; bulk deletion is blocked. Admin and Super Admin keep direct deletion. Nagpur/Chandrapur employee or contact records require their assigned HR Manager; other sites require their Project Manager. Contact requests must resolve exactly one employee/location. Pending requests preserve the original record, requester, reason, approver role and decision history in cdir_deletion_requests, which is included in full backups. Rejections require a reason; changed records/locations block stale approvals; transfers and deletions cannot overlap for one employee. Approval, deletion and notifications commit atomically. Deleting an employee does not cascade-delete separate contact records. Registers, record snapshots and history use shared export/PDF/Excel/print controls. Notifications open the scoped deletion approval workspace.

BDMS chatbot report answers include site-wise counts across all matching scoped records before limiting detail rows. Site summary includes each site’s Open, Running BD and Closed totals; dated BD counts and fleet availability include site status breakdowns. Fleet uses current equipment location. Transfers show source-site counts, support tickets show ticket-site totals, and related-request drill-downs include site counts. English/Hindi labels and Production ownership restrictions apply.

BDMS report menus default to the current IST date and display its weekday. Today, Yesterday, Last 7/30 days, Choose dates and Choose day apply across report navigation and drill-down. Telegram supports /date YYYY-MM-DD and /period YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD; the web assistant uses its report-date inputs. Weekday selection selects the most recent occurrence. Relative presets roll forward after midnight. Reports label their event-date basis; historical periods show current recorded statuses, while fleet availability remains a clearly labelled live snapshot. Invalid or future ranges leave the previous selection unchanged.

### IBoss report table controls
IBoss masters, transactions, dashboard details (including trade ageing), Report Merge and chatbot result tables use the shared Actions menu and Print/Export. Actions supports columns/order, filters, sorting, saved reports and Reset table. Bank-wise reconciliation and dashboard party lists use these controls too. The account ledger preserves its ERP layout and provides a Report table tab for these controls, narration and creator audit columns. Table filtering, sorting and exports cover loaded records only; use the Oracle search/date/company controls and pagination for the full source. Exports follow the visible filtered/sorted table. Controls open within the active native dialog so they remain accessible in dashboard and ledger pop-ups.

Smart Print automatically fits all columns to page width in landscape for printing and PDF/Excel export. Long reports continue vertically across pages. Browser print scaling has no lower floor, so very wide ageing tables fit without clipping. Excel workbooks define each sheet's complete print area, repeat the title/count/column headings, and use one page wide with automatic page height. Native browser/printer settings can still be overridden by the user.
